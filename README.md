# RMS-and-EDF-Scheduler
Implementation of an RMS and EDF Scheduler using C and a Python script for generating schedule plots.

The C program takes an input .txt file with task information and generates output .txt files with an RMS and EDF schedule.

The Python script plots those output files on a gantt chart with green circles to indicate task completitions and red crosses to indicate deadline misses.
